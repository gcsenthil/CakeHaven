# CakeHaven

This is a front-end project set up using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting.

## Project Structure

The project is designed to build and watch for changes in CSS files using Tailwind CSS. Additionally, Prettier is used to ensure the formatting of HTML files is consistent throughout the project.

### Files and Directories

- `build/`: The output directory where the compiled and minified CSS (`style.css`) will be placed.
